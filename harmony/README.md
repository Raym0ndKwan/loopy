# Loop — HarmonyOS NEXT

HarmonyOS NEXT port of the Loop ReAct agent starter. Matches the Android app:

- Chat UI with message input, send control, and event transcript
- `ReActAgentRunner` with Thought / Action / Observation / Final
- `ToolRegistry` with `time`, `note`, and **`ui`** (A2UI / AGenUI when the agent decides visual output helps)
- On-screen UI panel appears automatically when the agent calls the `ui` tool
- OpenAI-compatible HTTP adapter (DashScope / Qwen) plus scripted fallback

## Open in DevEco Studio

1. Install [DevEco Studio](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/deveco-studio/) with HarmonyOS NEXT SDK **6.1.0 (API 23)** for the checked-in build profile. AGenUI itself requires HarmonyOS NEXT SDK **5.0.5 (API 17)+**.
2. Open the `harmony/` folder as a project (not the repo root).
3. Configure signing under **File → Project Structure → Signing Configs** for device or emulator runs.
4. Sync/build, then run the `entry` module on a phone emulator or device.

If `ohpm install` fails looking for `@ohos/hvigor`, that package ships with DevEco Studio and must **not** be listed in `oh-package.json5` `devDependencies`. Use **File → Sync and Refresh Project** instead.

## AIPhone backend verification

Run the Loopy-side smoke before wiring this HAR into AIPhoneDemo:

```bash
cd harmony
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk \
  node scripts/verify-aiphone-backend.mjs
```

The smoke builds the `agent_core` HAR and checks the AIPhone contract in this repo:

- `LoopBackend` registers the AIPhone tool definitions and `dynamic.search`.
- Tool output is emitted as AIPhone A2UI JSONL lines.
- The migrated AIPhone runtime includes travel, train, flight, food, Gmail, YouTube, Calendar, Maps, social, and dynamic tool execution.
- Unsafe send tools are blocked instead of auto-executed, and missing provider/OAuth config remains a truthful runtime error instead of mock data.

To validate from AIPhoneDemo without touching the main working tree, create a temporary worktree and patch only that copy:

```bash
cd harmony
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk \
  node scripts/aiphonedemo-worktree-smoke.mjs --reset-worktree
```

That command prepares `/Users/luoyige/DevEcoStudioProjects/AIPhoneDemo-loopy-verify`, swaps its model client to `@loop/agent-core`, syncs local provider config when `tool-gateway/.env.local` exists, and builds a signed HAP. Add `--device-smoke` to install the temporary HAP and run AIPhoneDemo's `scripts/aiphone-device-smoke.mjs --full-regression` against the device.

When `--device-smoke` is used, the script reads the connected device API from `hdc shell param get const.ohos.apiversion`. API 22 devices get a temporary worktree-only product SDK patch to `6.0.2(22)` before build/install; API 23 devices use `6.1.0(23)`. Override this with `AIPHONE_VERIFY_PRODUCT_SDK='6.0.2(22)'` when you need to force a specific verification target.

## LLM provider config

Harmony reads provider settings from a raw resource file:

`entry/src/main/resources/rawfile/llm_config.json`

### Option A — sync from Android `local.properties`

If you already use the repo-root `local.properties` for Android:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/sync-harmony-llm-config.sh
./scripts/sync-harmony-llm-config.sh
```

That writes `llm_config.json` from:

```properties
llm.providerName=ali-bailian-openai
llm.apiKey=...
llm.baseUrl=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
llm.model=qwen-plus
```

### Option B — copy the example file

```bash
cp entry/src/main/resources/rawfile/llm_config.example.json \
   entry/src/main/resources/rawfile/llm_config.json
```

Edit `llm_config.json` and set `apiKey`.

If the provider is not configured, the app uses `ScriptedLocalModel` (same fallback as Android).

## Composio

The regular Loop chat registers a `composio` meta tool, discovers ACTIVE connected accounts at
startup, then lazily creates a tool-router session. Copy
`entry/src/main/resources/rawfile/composio_config.example.json` to `composio_config.json` and set
the scoped project `apiKey` plus the stable connected-account `userId`. The local config is ignored
by Git. Discovered tools execute immediately, including tools with side effects; production apps
should proxy Composio through their own backend.

## ModelScope MCP

The regular Loop chat registers a `modelscope` meta tool. For the current demo it connects directly
to ModelScope from the phone, without a local Gateway.

Copy `entry/src/main/resources/rawfile/modelscope_config.example.json` to
`entry/src/main/resources/rawfile/modelscope_config.json` and configure:

```json
{
  "mode": "direct",
  "modelscopeApiBaseUrl": "https://modelscope.cn",
  "modelscopeToken": "your ModelScope token"
}
```

The phone calls ModelScope's operational MCP API itself, lists the activated Hosted MCP tools, and
directly calls each Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint. This packages the ModelScope token into the app
rawfile and executes discovered tools immediately, so it is for internal demos only and must not be
shipped as a production architecture.

## Source layout

```text
agent_core/                   # HAR — shared ReAct agent library
  Index.ets                   # Public exports
  src/main/ets/
    agent/ReActAgentRunner.ets
    agent/ToolRegistry.ets
    model/OpenAiCompatibleModel.ets
    model/ScriptedLocalModel.ets
    model/LlmProvider.ets
    model/LoopModelFactory.ets

entry/                        # App UI module
  src/main/ets/
    pages/Index.ets           # Unified Loop chat + on-screen UI panel
    agenui/A2uiFallbackView.ets
    entryability/EntryAbility.ets

libs/
  agenui.har                  # AGenUI SDK (fetch via scripts/fetch-agenui.sh)
```

`entry/oh-package.json5` references the HAR:

```json5
"dependencies": {
  "@loop/agent-core": "file:../agent_core"
}
```

UI code imports from `@loop/agent-core`:

```typescript
import { ReActAgentRunner, ToolRegistry, createLoopModel } from '@loop/agent-core';
```

## Conversation memory

Loop keeps a history of user messages and final assistant answers in `ConversationContext`. Each successful run appends one user/assistant pair; failed runs are not stored. History is persisted to device preferences via `ConversationStore` and restored on launch (last 50 turns). Use **Clear** to reset the session and wipe stored history.

## AGenUI (generative UI)

Loop integrates [AGenUI](https://github.com/AGenUI/AGenUI) A2UI protocol via a **`ui` ReAct tool**. The agent chooses it when you ask to show, display, or visualize something — no separate GenUI mode.

### Example prompts

- `What time is it?` → text answer (time tool)
- `Show a welcome card for Raymond` → **ui tool** → card in the panel above chat
- `Display a weather summary card: Sunny 72°F` → on-screen UI

### Setup (optional native AGenUI HAR)

The unified app renders UI with a built-in ArkUI fallback (works in Preview). For the full AGenUI native SDK, fetch the HAR:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/fetch-agenui.sh
./scripts/fetch-agenui.sh
```

Sync in DevEco Studio. Requires HarmonyOS NEXT **API 17+** for the HAR dependency.

## Android parity notes

| Android | Harmony |
|---------|---------|
| `MainActivity.java` | `pages/Index.ets` |
| `local.properties` → Gradle `resValue` | `rawfile/llm_config.json` |
| `HttpURLConnection` | `@ohos.net.http` |
| `ExecutorService` + `Handler` | `async/await` in event handler |
| `INTERNET` permission in manifest | `ohos.permission.INTERNET` in `module.json5` |

## Replace the model

Implement `LocalModel` in `agent_core/src/main/ets/model/LocalModel.ets` and wire it in `LoopModelFactory.ets`. Keep responses compatible with:

```text
Thought: ...
Action: tool_name[input]
Final: ...
```
